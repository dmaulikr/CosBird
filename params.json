COSCUP is the largest annual FLOSS conference organized by local communities in Taiwan.\r\n\r\nMy talk topic is about \"Openframeworks x Mobile.\" I introduced Openframeworks and show a OF demo on iphone implementation in this conference. In order to show the benefit on OF, I designed a small game which combined \"audio input,\" \"audio output,\" \"graphic drawing,\" \"image drawing\" and \"touch event\" features and use COSCUP moscot as actor.\r\n\r\nMy slides is here. http://www.slideshare.net/janetyc/of-mobile\r\n\r\nCosBird is an iPhone application created by openframeworks v007. :)\r\n\r\n\r\njanet\r\n09/03/2011\r\n"}
